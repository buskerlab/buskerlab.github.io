<h1>Our Philosophy behind Flight of Ohana.</h1>
<div class="contents">
We developed this game with the goal of making an experience that you could enjoy with those dearest to you. We developed this game by playing with our own families. Because of the memories created with our loved ones, this became more than just a game for us.<br>
<br>
Now you too can join up with your family, friends, or significant other, and make new memories together as Pepe and Kahu. Try out team play, and come up with tricks and strategies together to guide these characters to safety.<br>

<div class="contents">
In two-player mode, Flight of Ohana can be played on tablets or smartphones with two people taking the controls side by side. You each control your character by touching the area of the screen closest to you.<br>
<br>
When playing in two-player mode, dialogue and close cooperation are essential.<br>
